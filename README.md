# Torrent scraper TUI

This program is slow. Idc about the speed :)

Usage:
```
git clone <url>
cd torrent_scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python torrent_scraper.py
```

Note: Consider creating a venv 
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python torrent_scraper.py
```
You will have to run `source venv/bin/activate` everytime before running the program if you're using a venv
